Guidelines
- Fork the repository and create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b my-feature`.
- Keep changes focused and include tests for new behavior.
- Run the test suite locally: `python -m pytest -q`.
- Write clear commit messages and include a short description in pull requests.

Code style
- Follow existing project layout and naming conventions.
- Use descriptive variable names; avoid one-letter names.

Submitting changes
- Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against `main`.
- CI will run tests automatically; address any failures before merging.

Security disclosure
- For security-sensitive issues, prefer reporting to the project owner privately; see SECURITY.md for details.
